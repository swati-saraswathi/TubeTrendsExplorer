This project encompassed a comprehensive analysis of the top 1000 YouTubers, leveraging a meticulously curated dataset containing pertinent details such as rankings, usernames, categories, subscribers, country of origin, video views, likes, comments, and channel links. The dataset underwent rigorous preprocessing to rectify discrepancies and handle missing values judiciously. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were employed, coupled with insightful visualizations, to discern patterns and characteristics inherent in the YouTuber landscape.

The initial phase of the analysis involved an in-depth exploration of the dataset structure, with particular attention to identifying and addressing missing values. The "Categories" column, in particular, exhibited instances of missing information, which were systematically filled with the designated label "Unknown." Ensuring uniformity in nomenclature, the "Suscribers" column was renamed to "Subscribers," and rows with missing values were selectively removed.

The subsequent phase featured an array of visualizations designed to provide a holistic understanding of the dataset's intricacies. Prominent visualizations included a categorical count plot delineating YouTuber distribution across different content categories, bar plots illustrating the distribution of subscribers and average likes per category, a heatmap elucidating the correlation matrix of numerical variables, and bar charts highlighting top channels based on views and subscribers.

To augment interpretability, language translation was integrated using the Google Translate API, applied to both category and country names. This measure facilitated a more comprehensive comprehension of content categories and the geographical locations of the featured YouTubers.

Advanced visualizations were crafted using Plotly Express, including a pie chart encapsulating the distribution of video categories within the top 20, and a sunburst chart depicting YouTubers categorized by country, content category, and username.

Furthermore, the implementation of collaborative filtering via cosine similarity yielded a sophisticated recommendation system. This system discerns and suggests YouTubers with analogous content based on user preferences. For instance, if a user expresses a proclivity for a particular YouTuber's content, the system adeptly recommends analogous content creators.
